        <h2>AGE</h2>
		<p>Personal space gets bigger with age. For instance, children are happy when they are physically closer to each other, but as they start to be aware of their sexuality, they feel comfortable when space increases.
</p>
        <h2>GENDER</h2>
		<p>Years of research have revealed that men claim more personal space than women, that women manifest less discomfort than men when confronted with a small amount of space, that men seem to approach females more closely than females who move toward men, that women, when given the opportunity, seek to interact at a closer distance than do men and that men more frequently walk in front of their female partner than vice versa.
</p>
        <h2>PERSONALITY</h2>   
		<p>Personality is known to play a significant role in determining the size of personal space. Cold and quarrelsome people require a larger personal space while gregarious people require a smaller one.
</p>
        <h2>CULTURE</h2>
		<p>Different cultures use personal space to communicate. The size of personal space varies from one culture to the next.</p>
