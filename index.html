<P>What is personal space? </p>
<p>Let's watch a video first!

<h2><a name="T1">Definition</a></h2>
<p>Personal space is the physical space that immediately surrounds someone. </p>
<p>If another person gets into this physical space, the owner will feel uncomfortable or threatened.</p>
<hr/>

<h2><a name="T2">In China</a></h2>

<p>Personal space in China is different therefore the level of discomfort is different too. <br/>
You might find that if you take a step back, they will take a step closer to you. <br/>
The Chinese population is the first thing that most people notice when they come to China.<br/> 
The population density in China has a great effect on what personal space means to people here.<br/>  
In China, living space is close. </br>
Sometimes entire generations of families will be living together, eating, sleeping, working, and playing all in the same one room.<br/> 
These type of living conditions are not exclusive to China, but also other Asian countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and various tribal regions.<br/> 
Through the years, as these close family communities migrated from field to city, the closeness of community togetherness and habits also moved to the cities. <br/>
Perhaps differences in the concept of personal space also has to do with China’s communist and socialist influence.<br/> 
Socialist history often revolves around a culture where space, work, basic functions of living and belongings are shared.<br/> 
The socialist concepts based on the collective versus individual also have an influence on this topic.<br/> 
In Asia there’s a much more collective and often family approach to doing thing, while in the US, there is a highly promoted individualistic culture.<br/>
Down time, alone time, and in your own space/place in the US is respected and expected.</p>
